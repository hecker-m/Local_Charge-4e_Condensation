# Local_Charge-4e_Condensation
Following the ideas outlined in https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02005 , I minimize the variational free energy using a short matlab code.

We find a local condensation of a charge-4e superconducting state at a nematic domain wall, where the (leading) competing order locally vanishes.
